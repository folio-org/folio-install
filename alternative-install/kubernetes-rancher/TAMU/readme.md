## Introduction

This extensive how-to guide is spread across two documents, and describes how Texas A&M University Libraries Folio infrastructure is configured and deployed at a basic level. We maintain many of our own artifacts for Folio deployments, but there are also community-provided Helm charts and Docker containers for modules, Okapi and configuration.<br/>

I assume the reader has extensive knowledge in Docker and Kubernetes, and a basic understanding of how Folio functions. My goal is to be descriptive on how things are done through the Rancher UI, more advanced users can interact directly with the K8s cluster via kubectl.<br/>
